* Corpses seem to block line-of-sight of magic attacks. Can this be turned off?
* Can I get rid of corpses entirely? How do I do this?
* All other map events on my map (buildings, lamps, fire hydrants, cars, etc.) disappear during battle. I need them to always be visible!
* The image I use for the map's ground level also disappears. I am using the Bind Pictures To Map plugin.
* I want to use action points instead of whatever is being used currently. I want to be able to use the same pool of action points for whatever actions I choose, including movement. I want to also be able to see the number of action points remaining in the GUI. Is this possible?
* I want the turn order boxes at the top of the screen to show faces instead of battlers, since my battlers are bigger than 48x48 pixels. Can this be done?
* Not sure what to do with respect to "_dead" sprites. My characters are taller than 48x48 pixels, and will require more space when lying on the ground than is currently afforded (unless I can think of a clever alternative). Currently, I just place an icon of a skull and bones on the map where they die.
* It can be hard to select a target using the mouse, because the game scrolls the map when clicking on an enemy. I think this only happens with double clicks. E.g. the map scrolls between the first and second mouse click, so the second click is always a miss.
* The GUI on the far left side of the screen obscures characters if they are also on the far left side of the screen. (One solution might be to add empty space around the sides of the map, so that the game window can scroll farther in every direction.)
* Need to move the stop sign slightly to the right.
* Very slight but noticeable flicker or "jiggle" of the event sprites when the camera scrolls across the map.
* Btw the no_corpse is useless now. Not having the pose(dead) instruction is the equivalent now.
* When you kill the last enemy, the enemy is not replaced with a corpse. This does not affect the outcome of the battle, however.
